This repository contains practice materials and home assignments for the "Energy Data Science 2024" course.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (suggested name - `.venv`):

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - Linux/macOS:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   - Windows:

   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note:** Update `requirements.txt` each time new packages are installed using:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** It is good habit to deactivate venv after using:

```
deactivate
```
